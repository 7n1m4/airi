## Local Runtimes & Desktop Automation

### Local WebGPU RWKV Enhancements & State Cartridges
*References: [proposal-built-in-llm-webgpu.md](../../../../../proposal-built-in-llm-webgpu.md) | [project-rwkv-cleanroom-harness-plan.md](../../../../../project-rwkv-cleanroom-harness-plan.md) | [proposal-generative-code-painting-rwkv-webllm.md](../../../../../proposal-generative-code-painting-rwkv-webllm.md)*
*   **State Cartridge Loading & Ingestion**: Integrate verified cleanroom state loading (`scripts/tests/rwkv-harness/`) into the active WebGPU Web Worker (`packages/stage-ui/src/workers/web-rwkv/`). Enables loading modular `.state` files (e.g. bilingual roleplay, character personality cartridges, `p5-watercolor-1.5b.state`).
*   **Prompt Template & Model Selector**: Add a prompt template configuration selector and custom model URL input to allow power users to load arbitrary Hugging Face safetensors.

### Next-Gen Local Inference: Edge0 Dynamic MoE Streaming & MiniCPM-5 Starter Runtime
*Reference: [proposal-local-inference-edge0-minicpm.md](../../../../../proposal-local-inference-edge0-minicpm.md)*
*   **Tier 1: MiniCPM-5 2B (In-Browser Web Worker / WebLLM & ONNX Web)**: 100% in-browser WebGPU worker runtime (~1.2–1.5 GB VRAM in 4-bit, zero sidecar, zero native build requirements) serving as an instant offline starter brain with state-of-the-art reasoning and strict JSON tool compliance across web and desktop.

*References: [project-selective-upstream-sync-shortlist.md](../../../../../project-selective-upstream-sync-shortlist.md) | [design-conversational-group-bot.md](../../../../../design-conversational-group-bot.md)*
*   **Desktop Computer-Use MCP Integration (`@proj-airi/computer-use-mcp`) [Deferred]**:
    *   Technical evaluation completed for upstream's macOS orchestration service `services/computer-use-mcp` as an architectural addition.
    *   **Scope & Deferred Rationale**: Provides native desktop actions (Quartz clicking/typing/hotkeys), browser DOM bridge (`ws://127.0.0.1:8765`), and terminal runner. Deferred due to non-trivial configuration footprint: requires macOS Accessibility/Screen Recording permissions, interactive action-approval dialogs, application whitelisting, and Chrome extension pairing.
*   **Character Card Density & Compliance Model (`CardCreationTabGeneration.vue`)**:
    *   Introduce paired physical execution bounds (`maxTokens`, `maxBubblesPerTurn`, `maxLinesPerTarget`) coupled with dynamic system prompt compliance prose teaching models how to naturally chunk dialogue without performative cadence.
*   **Discord Group Dynamics & Ambient Tuning (`MessagingDiscord.vue` `'group'` Tab)**:
    *   **Batch Ingestion Throttling**: Reactive `collectDebounceMs` (2,500ms) and `maxBatchWaitMs` (6,000ms) under `/chatmode collect` to digest high-velocity multi-user bursts into unified turns.
    *   **Dual Outbound Delivery Paradigms**:
        *   *Multi-Bubble Stagger (Sarah Style)*: Multi-target `<reply to="...">` / `<ambient>` block parsing with natural typing delays (40ms/char) and `<react to="..." emoji="..."/>` Discord emoji reactions.
        *   *Real-Time SSE Streaming (Nanori Style)*: Live token streaming via Discord `message.edit()` with a mandatory 2,500ms rate-limit safety floor to prevent HTTP 429 locks.
    *   **Conversational Appetite Slider**: Configurable modes (Reserved / Natural Conversationalist / Hyper-Enthusiastic) with `NO_REPLY` silence sentinel drop routing.

## Consciousness & Cognitive Pipeline

### TypeSafe Jev System-1 Cognitive Engine & Multi-Subsystem Wiring
*Reference: [proposal-jev-integration.md](../../../../../proposal-jev-integration.md)*
*   **Streaming Speech-to-Motion & Expression Classifier**:
    *   Evaluate streaming sentence strides in real time (~110–140ms) via Jev `choice` and `score` primitives during TTS pre-synthesis.
    *   Dynamically dispatch Live2D/VRM/Stage-Mate facial expressions (`smug`, `flustered`, `tender`) and ACT motion triggers (`nod`, `lean_forward`, `tilt`) with zero inline XML token generation overhead in the primary LLM.
*   **Memory Token Compaction & Pre-Summary Salience Curation**:
    *   Pre-filter raw multi-turn conversation logs before invoking heavy System-2 daily/lifetime summarizers.
    *   Strip routine banter and transient small-talk, compacting transcript token volume by ~70% and isolating high-salience biographical anchors and emotional milestones.
*   **Arcade Room Retro Games & Interactive Backseat Gaming (`chat_arcade.vue`)**:
    *   Run 10 Hz carry-hold game actuation loops (JS-DOS retro titles / ViZDoom) while the companion streams gameplay in the Arcade Room.
    *   Inject live user chat/voice suggestions into dynamic `standingOrders` situation reports at the next 100ms cycle, enabling interactive backseat gaming and contextual audio-ducked banter.

### Prefix Cache Alignment & Prompt Compilation Controls
*Reference: [proposal-prefix-cache-alignment.md](../../../../../proposal-prefix-cache-alignment.md)*
*   **Unified Context Builder & Settings Store**: Implement `useContextBuilder` to dry up prompt construction across Proactivity/Destiny 2/Producer and create `useSettingsLlmPerformance`. Prefix alignment logic verified with `scripts/validate-prefix-cache.js`.

### Proactivity System Enrichments
*Reference: [project-proactivity-enrichment-roadmap.md](../../../../../project-proactivity-enrichment-roadmap.md)*
*   **Cognition Tab Synergy & Behavioral Enrichments**:
    *   Clipboard Metadata Buffer (rolling buffer of last 5 clipboard events).
    *   Invisible Emotion Meters (cumulative sentiment meters: Trust, Patience, Playfulness).
    *   Physical Model Tracking (click/mouse coordinates mapped to VRM bones / Live2D hit areas).
    *   Media Now Playing comments & Temporal/Day Tropes.

### Chatbox Conversational Anchoring & Contextual Bubble Reply
*Reference: [proposal-chatbox-revamp.md](../../../../proposal-chatbox-revamp.md)*
*   **Message-Level Provenance & Attention Anchoring**: Enable users to circle back to older conversation turns without semantic confusion. Contextually replying to an earlier bubble prefixes a model-only attention anchor (`[Replying to: <text>]`) to the outgoing prompt turn, overcoming recency bias and binding the LLM's response directly to the cited topic across conversational drift.
*   **Bubble Context Menu Integration (No Swipe)**: Provide a clean desktop-first entry point via the bubble contextual menu positioned near the top next to "Retry". Explicitly bypasses mobile gesture/swipe capture bloat while offering instant access to reply targeting.
*   **Composer Quote Drawer & Inline Bubble Attribution**: Display an expandable, dismissible reply preview banner above the composer input (`Replying to <Speaker>: "<text>" [✕]`) and render an inline quote header inside the sent bubble to preserve visual provenance in the session timeline with click-to-ancestor jumping.
