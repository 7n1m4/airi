  Review roadmap/RFCs, verify proposed versus shipped features, compare forks, plan selective upstream ports. Never inspect/fetch/rebase/push upstream without explicit authorization. Use for research and planning.
---

Research first, port deliberately. This fork is highly divergent; the `upstream` remote is reference-only. Never push, rebase from, fetch, or otherwise inspect `upstream` unless the user explicitly authorizes it. Never cite `crates/` (legacy Tauri; current desktop is Electron `apps/stage-tamagotchi/`).

## Key Files/Locations

- `docs/content/en/docs/chronicles/roadmap.md` — the "AIRI Pending Items Catalog": the source of truth for triaging unbuilt features (core infra, local runtimes, consciousness/cognitive pipeline, memory & RAG, speech/audio, visual manifestation, integration architecture). Note some entries are already `[COMPLETED]` — read carefully before treating a feature as unbuilt.
- `docs/memory_lab/` — a folder of memory-system design specs, plans, and analysis docs (retrieval/ranking, schema/lifecycle, replay/eval plans, benchmark history).
- `docs/proposal-*.md` (and `docs/design-*.md`) — the architectural proposal RFCs and design docs under `docs/`.
- Git remotes — run `git remote -v` to enumerate the fork's named remotes (e.g. `origin` = `dasilva333/airi`, `upstream` = `moeru-ai/airi`, plus several fork remotes). Upstream diff comes from these remotes, not from invented paths.

## When to Use

- Triage an unbuilt roadmap feature to decide whether/how to build it.
- Read or evaluate an architectural proposal RFC before implementing.
- Inspect upstream repo changes / PRs to understand what upstream did.
- Compare divergent fork paths across the named remotes.
- Plan a port of upstream/fork work into this divergent fork.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Touching `upstream` without authorization.** Upstream is reference-only. No `push`/`rebase`/`fetch`/`inspect` of `upstream` (or any remote mutation) unless the user explicitly authorizes it — and a greenlight is one-time, for that checkpoint only.
- **Treating the roadmap as all-unbuilt.** Read each roadmap entry; several are already marked `[COMPLETED]` or carry priority tags. Verify current source before assuming a feature is missing.
- **Assuming a proposal doc reflects shipped code.** Proposal documents are design intent. If a proposal conflicts with current source, source wins — verify against the actual files before planning.
- **Recommending Obsolete or Superseded Surfaces.** Upstream still actively develops on surfaces that this fork deprecated and removed months ago (e.g. `controls-island`). Never recommend upstream commits or PRs modifying `controls-island` as cherry-pick candidates.
- **Scope creep on a port.** Port narrowly and deliberately; do not bundle a broad refactor into a research/port task. Root-cause and state the proposed approach and tradeoffs, and wait for approval before changing application code (pair-programming rule).
- **Momentum toward commit/push.** Never proactively commit or push. The user decides when a tested checkpoint becomes a commit and when it is published; validate before any push.

## Architectural Divergences: What Sets This Fork Apart

This fork (`dasilva333/airi`) has undergone deep, structural architectural shifts that separate it from upstream (`moeru-ai/airi`). When conducting research or triaging PRs, evaluate changes against these core distinctions:

1. **Decoupled Desktop Surfaces (Control Strip vs. Control Island)**:
   - In commit `e10223f2e`, this fork deleted the legacy monolithic `controls-island/` inside the stage window.
   - The desktop was cleanly split into the **Actor Stage** (`windows/stage`, `RendererStage.vue` dedicated solely to avatar rendering) and the **Main Window / Control Strip** (`windows/main`, `ControlStrip.vue`, `ControlStripHost.vue` floating ribbon).
   - Upstream never decoupled this and still patches `controls-island` (e.g. Wayland hover fixes, menus). **Upstream `controls-island` changes are permanent auto-rejects for porting.**
2. **Local-First & Privacy Invariant vs. Hosted Cloud / Commercial Services**:
   - This fork is strictly local-first desktop with Bring Your Own Storage (BYOS: S3/R2/Google Drive backup), local unstorage/localforage persistence, and zero online accounts.
   - Upstream actively develops hosted cloud services, remote database provider syncing (e.g. PR #2471), Stripe billing for Flux (PR #2533), Apple App Store IAP (PR #2339), and remote email verification (PR #2473).
3. **Multi-Actor & `<|ACTOR|>` Dynamic Staging**:
   - This fork supports `<|ACTOR|>` tokens for mid-conversation dynamic character switching, LRU display model caching, and multi-actor character cards. Upstream is strictly 1:1 character cards.
4. **Expanded Avatar Runtimes (4 Engines + Unity Companion)**:
   - This fork natively supports 4 avatar engines (VRM, Live2D, MMD with PMX physics, Spine 2D) and a high-fidelity Unity C# sidecar (`apps/stage-mate`). Upstream focuses on VRM/Live2D and Godot 4 experiments.
5. **Two-Layer Memory & Dreaming Subsystems**:
   - This fork features STMM daily summaries, LTMM immutable text journal with `text_journal` tool, Sacred Journal Rule, Dreaming Worker reflections, Echo chips, and Universe/storyline isolation.
6. **Autonomous Artistry & BYOW**:
   - Native ComfyUI API direct integration with Bring-Your-Own-Workflow `workflow_api.json` node mapping and autonomous Director decision loops.
7. **Speech & Audio Pipeline Awareness**:
   - **Web Speech API** (`browser-web-speech-api`): Browser-native STT; routes audio data over the network to browser vendor servers (e.g. Google).
   - **Apple Speech** (`SFSpeechRecognizer`): Native Apple framework supporting genuine on-device offline recognition on Apple Silicon.
   - While Apple Speech has legitimate on-device privacy value, it is currently an upstream-focused provider not wired in this fork. Distinguish these architectures carefully rather than conflating them or recommending unported provider patches.
8. **Responses API & Hosted Server-Side Gateways**:
   - This fork is strictly client/local-first with direct provider connections and local WebGPU/WASM inference (`packages/provider-inference`, `packages/stage-ui/src/stores/providers`).
   - Upstream actively develops a hosted `/v1/responses` gateway (OpenResponses schema, Flux billing, OpenRouter routing in `server/apps/api`).
   - **Filter Rule**: This fork does not support the Responses API (at least not yet, and there is no plan to do so). All upstream changes touching `/v1/responses` or OpenResponses are auto-rejects and can be safely ignored.
9. **Native In-Process Memory & Cognition vs. External Daemon Bridges (Cortico PR #2634)**:
   - This fork is strictly 100% in-process: character memory is powered natively by the Eight Pillars (STMM daily summaries, LTMM immutable Sacred Journal, Echo chips, distilled Lifetime Artifacts, and Orama hybrid search) stored directly in client-side IndexedDB (`local:*`) and `localforage`.
   - It requires zero secondary terminal processes, zero daemons, and maintains full parity across Desktop (Electron), Web, and Mobile (Capacitor).
   - Upstream PR #2634 proposes offloading character cognition and persona to an external Cortico daemon (`@proj-airi/cortico-bridge` on `ws://localhost:6122`), breaking single-command launch (`pnpm dev:bridge` requirement), gutting native memory settings pages, breaking Web/Mobile compatibility, and relying on raw unindexed host directory scans. **External persona daemons are auto-rejects for core adoption.**

## Upstream Radar Watchlist (High-Interest Monitored PRs)

Maintain an active rolling monitor of high-impact upstream PRs during scheduled radar checks. When running `scripts/upstream-tracker.mjs`, evaluate changes in discussion velocity, maintainer triage, or lifecycle transitions for these specific items:

- **PR #2634: `[WIP] feat(cortico-bridge): embed Cortico persona core as AIRI's brain`**
  - **Author**: `@peachoolong-uwu` | **State**: Draft
  - **Focus**: Community proposal to replace native memory with an external Cortico WebSocket daemon (`ws://localhost:6122`).
  - **Monitoring Objective**: Track upstream maintainer reactions (@luoling8192, @nekomeowww) regarding the 2-process developer friction (`pnpm dev:bridge`), loss of Web/Mobile parity, and deletion of native memory settings. Hold off on commenting until maintainers officially weigh in.
- **PR #2550: `feat(hearing): add bundled Sherpaw speech recognition`**
  - **Author**: `@luoling8192` | **State**: Open
  - **Focus**: Local streaming speech recognition bundling offline Paraformer/Zipformer models packaged via tsdown.
  - **Monitoring Objective**: Monitor model packaging and asset delivery for potential porting to local-first speech pipeline.
- **PR #2641: `feat(stage-ui): show chat image analysis status`**
  - **Author**: `@luoling8192` | **State**: Open
  - **Focus**: Accessible live status indicators in chat history while uncached images undergo vision analysis.
  - **Monitoring Objective**: Evaluate visual polish for adoption once merged upstream.

## Upstream Radar vs. Cherry-Pick Triage SOP

- **Reconnaissance Tracking (Observe Everything)**:
  - The upstream radar in `docs/UPSTREAM_RADAR.md` MUST capture the full macro picture: commits, PRs, comments, cloud features, Stripe, billing, auth, and community velocity.
  - The user wants visibility into upstream's total trajectory, even for features this fork will never adopt.
- **Cherry-Pick Triage (Filter Deliberately)**:
  - When recommending **Cherry-Pick Candidates**, strictly filter against the architectural shifts above.
  - Never recommend `controls-island` fixes, hosted cloud auth/billing, or single-actor assumptions.
  - Only recommend high-value bugfixes, UI primitives, or features that cleanly fit the fork's decoupled architecture.

## Verification

- Read the specific roadmap entry and locate (or confirm the absence of) the corresponding current source before concluding a feature is unbuilt.
- Confirm remote names with `git remote -v`; cite upstream/fork diffs from real remotes, not invented paths.
- For any research that leads to a code change proposal, state the decision point and tradeoffs and get approval before implementing.
- After any modification made during the task, run `git status` and report open/unstaged files.
